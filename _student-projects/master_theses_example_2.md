## Abstract 

This master thesis investigates advanced distributed machine learning algorithms specifically designed for edge computing infrastructures. The research focuses on developing efficient coordination mechanisms for distributed training and inference across heterogeneous edge nodes.

The work addresses fundamental challenges in distributed edge learning including fault tolerance, load balancing, and adaptive resource allocation. Novel algorithms are proposed for dynamic workload distribution and real-time performance optimization.

Research contributions:
- Adaptive resource allocation algorithms for heterogeneous edge nodes
- Fault-tolerant distributed learning protocols
- Performance optimization for real-time edge applications
