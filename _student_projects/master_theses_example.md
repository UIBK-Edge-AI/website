## Abstract 

This master thesis presents a comprehensive study on implementing federated learning algorithms for IoT edge devices in smart city environments. The research addresses key challenges including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation in distributed machine learning systems.

The proposed framework enables collaborative learning across diverse IoT devices while ensuring data locality and reducing communication overhead. The work includes implementation of novel aggregation algorithms and evaluation on real-world smart city datasets.

Key contributions include:
- Novel federated aggregation algorithm for heterogeneous IoT devices
- Privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive urban data
- Performance evaluation in realistic smart city scenarios
