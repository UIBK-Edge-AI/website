# Navigation Configuration for Jekyll Site
# Updated to include Research dropdown functionality
#
# The following is the order of the links in the header of the website.
# Changing the order here will adjust the order and you can also add additional
# links. Removing a link prevents it from showing in the header, but does not
# prevent it from being included in the site.
