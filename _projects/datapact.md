## DataPACT: Embedding Compliance, Ethics, and Sustainability into the Core of Data and AI Operations

### Motivation
- Address Emerging Compliance Risks
    Rapid advances in AI and data services have unlocked vast potential—but also introduced challenges: untested algorithms, data privacy concerns, regulatory non-compliance, and environmental impact.

- Embed Ethics and Sustainability
    DataPACT ensures that compliance, privacy, and environmental sustainability are not afterthoughts, but core design principles for AI and data pipelines 

- Enable Trustworthy Data Ecosystems
    By embedding transparency and ethical considerations into operations, the project aims to build trust in AI systems among users, regulators, and society

### Project Goals
- Develop a Compliance Toolbox & Framework

    - Create user-friendly tools for automated compliance assessment, including privacy, fairness, and environmental impacts.

    - Provide developers with frameworks to embed compliance upfront 

- Deliver a Pipeline Management Toolbox

    - Design a compliance-aware pipeline toolbox that supports the full lifecycle: design → simulation → deployment → monitoring → traceability

    - Ensure energy monitoring and carbon footprint estimation are integrated into runtime operations 


- Validate Through Real-World Use Cases

    - Apply the tools in seven diverse sectors—healthcare, smart cities, media, law enforcement, CRM, manufacturing, public data—to ensure scalability and practical adoption 

    - Support European Data Spaces & Interoperability

- Promote federated, open European data spaces by ensuring interoperability, traceability, and secure data exchange 

    - Accelerate Compliant AI Market Readiness

    - Help organizations reduce time-to-market for AI applications, with built-in regulatory compliance and lower environmental impact
