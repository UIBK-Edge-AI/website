## DataPACT: Embedding Compliance, Ethics, and Sustainability into the Core of Data and AI Operations

### Motivation
We are proud to contribute to **DataPACT**, a **Horizon Europe-funded** initiative that redefines how data and AI systems are built—embedding compliance, ethics, and sustainability from the ground up. Our team leads the design of the DataPACT architecture, which serves as the blueprint for integrating diverse tools and frameworks.

We also play a central role in enabling compliance-aware **Data/AI operations**, empowering users to interact with pipelines through intuitive, **intent-driven interfaces**. In addition, we contribute to shaping the next generation of **pipeline design tools**, leveraging **large language models to support the creation of transparent, trustworthy, and regulation-ready workflows.

### Project Goals
Together with 17 other partners from across Europe, we are developing cutting-edge solutions to ensure that data-driven innovation respects privacy, complies with regulations such as the GDPR and the AI Act, and minimizes environmental impact. DataPACT’s impact spans healthcare, smart cities, public services, and beyond — making AI not just powerful, but principled.
