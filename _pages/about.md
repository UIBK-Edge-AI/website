We are a research group dedicated to advancing the development and practical application of Artificial Intelligence at the edge of the network — where users and devices operate. Our work focuses on creating intelligent, efficient, and secure AI systems that can run on edge devices with limited resources, enabling real-time decision-making and enhanced privacy. By bridging AI innovation with edge computing, we aim to empower smarter environments in healthcare, mobility, industry, and beyond.

About
======
The Edge AI Lab is established with the appointment of the Professor Dr. Radu Prodan at the University of Innsbruck in March 2025. 

He is a globally renowned leading researcher specializing in distributed and parallel computing systems, applied AI, and big data processing and analytics. He directs the recently established "AIM AT endowed professorship for Edge AI" research group and has served as principal investigator and coordinator for many national and international research projects.

Research
======
The Edge AI Lab is known for its interdisciplinary approach to solving critical challenges in artificial intelligence at the edge of the network, with specific emphasis on:

* **Edge AI optimization and deployment** - Developing efficient AI models for resource-constrained devices
* **Privacy-preserving edge computing** - Implementing federated learning and differential privacy techniques
* **Real-time decision-making systems** - Creating intelligent systems for healthcare, mobility, and industrial applications
* **Sustainable AI operations** - Minimizing environmental impact of AI computations at the edge
* **Compliance-aware AI pipelines** - Ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance in data-driven systems
* **Secure edge computing architectures** - Protecting data sovereignty and privacy in distributed systems
* **Human-AI interaction at the edge** - Designing user-centric AI systems for smart environments
* **AI for smart cities and IoT ecosystems** - Enabling intelligent urban infrastructure and connected devices

We actively collaborate with leading research institutions and industry partners across Europe and internationally, including partnerships established through multiple european projects, where we work alongside:

**Academic Partners:**
- University of Southampton (IT Innovation Centre)
- Leibniz Universität Hannover  
- Hochschule Offenburg
- Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt
- SINTEF (Norway)
- Jozef Stefan Institute (Slovenia)
- Fraunhofer ITWM and Fraunhofer ISST (Germany)

**Industry Collaborations:**
- Intel Corporation
- Continental AG
- Capgemini Engineering
- T-Systems
- DLR (German Aerospace Center)
- IAV (automotive engineering)
- ASSIST Software (Romania)

**Technology Partners:**
- International Data Spaces Association (IDSA)
- Eticas Foundation (AI ethics)
- HighQSoft (quality assurance)
- Conweaver (data analytics)

Our research particularly focuses on creating **compliant, ethical, and sustainable AI systems** that can operate efficiently at the edge while respecting privacy, fundamental rights, and environmental considerations. Through these collaborations, we contribute to developing open, trusted, and federated European data spaces that enhance the reliability and interoperability of edge AI solutions across various sectors including healthcare, smart cities, manufacturing, and autonomous systems.
