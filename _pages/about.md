Research Ethos
======
We are a research group dedicated to advancing the development and practical application of Artificial Intelligence at the network's edge, where users and devices operate. Our work focuses on creating scalable, sustainable, and secure AI systems distributed on edge devices with limited capabilities, backed by powerful clouds and supercomputers, enabling robust decision-making and enhanced privacy. By combining AI innovation with edge computing, we aim to create smarter environments hosting and operating innovative industrial applications from social media, smart cities, medicine, finance, and more.

Research Topics
======
The Edge AI Lab is known for its interdisciplinary approach to solving critical challenges in artificial intelligence at the edge of the network, with specific emphasis on:

* **Edge computing**
* **Applied machine learning**
* **Federated and Embedded machine learning**
* **Graph Artificial Intelligence**
* **Cloud and High-performance Computing**
* **Scheduling and Resource Management**
* **Compliance, Ethics, Sustainability**
* **AI for Smart cities and IoT ecosystems**
