We are a research group dedicated to advancing the development and practical application of Artificial Intelligence at the edge of the network â€” where users and devices operate. Our work focuses on creating intelligent, efficient, and secure AI systems that can run on edge devices with limited resources, enabling real-time decision-making and enhanced privacy. By bridging AI innovation with edge computing, we aim to empower smarter environments in healthcare, mobility, industry, and beyond.
